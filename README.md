Project Title: Heart Disease Classification


1. Project Objective:

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease based on certain medical attributes.


2. Dataset:

For this project, the dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which is commonly used for heart disease classification tasks. The dataset contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. It consists of a total of [insert dataset size] samples.


3. Problem Type:

This project involves a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease (1) or does not have heart disease (0) based on the given attributes.



4. Dataset Features:


age: Age of the patient.

sex: Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).

chest_pain_type: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient (0, 1, 2, or 3).

resting_bp: Resting blood pressure of the patient (in mm Hg).

cholestoral: Serum cholesterol levels of the patient (in mg/dl).

fasting_blood_sugar: Fasting blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, or 2).

max_hr: Maximum heart rate achieved by the patient.

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

num_major_vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.

thal: Thalassemia (0, 1, 2, or 3).

target: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
